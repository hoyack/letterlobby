Generic single-database configuration.

# Running Migrations
Access the App container shell and run migrations inside it
```
docker compose exec app sh
alembic -c alembic/alembic.ini revision -m "Add is_verified to users"
alembic -c alembic/alembic.ini upgrade head
```

# Known Issue
Due to the .env calling `host.docker.internal` the alembic commands error while running locally.
Solving this requires running the commands inside the container
You must save the version file that is created in the container `alembic/versions` subfolder
This must be saved to the repo to maintain proper migration chains.

# Bug Fix Recommendation
Running migrations from a local environment and committing the changes would be a better approach
